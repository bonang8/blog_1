   Haskell's Got Style 
   ____________________________________________
    ** Functional Programming 
    Haskell is a purely functional programming language. Functional programming is a style of programming 
    in which the basic method of computation is the application of functions to arguments(p.4). 
    To put simply, functions can be used as arguments. How does functional programming benefit us?
    Given Haskell's ability to treat functions as values, the code is easier to debug and it's more concise.

   We Love Lazy Languages
   ____________________________________________
    Haskell is lazy. To illustrate this concept, consider the following puesdo code below: 
    if(a & b) 
    {
       // do something...
       
     } 
    Similar to C++ or Java, Haskell will execute the code within the block if and only if 'a' and 'b' are true. 
    So if 'a' and 'b' are true, "do something". 
    However, if 'a' is false, we immediately know that the condition is not true. There is no need to 
    evaluate/execute "do something". 
    
  
   Useful Tips in Haskell

   ** Which external sources (videos, blogs, tutorials, etc) do you find most useful?
   Top two must read resources are: 
      1. Learn you a Haskell for Great Good 
      2. Programming in Haskell. 
   Both illustrate ideas imperative to Haskell in the most simplest way. 
   
   
   
   How does Haskell compare to your favourite programming language? Give examples of the same algorithm written in your favourite language and in Haskell. 
   What are the respectives strengths and weaknesses of the two programming paradigms?

   **   What are, in your opinion, the major stumbling blocks in learning Haskell?
    It is an indisputable fact (at least in my book) that Haskell can be a pain...at first. 
    The shift from a C++ background to Java and Python was not as troublesome from my transition to Haskell. 
    However, for those who did not struggle, congratulations! To start, Haskell is different from any programming
    language I have ever learned. As stated earlier, Haskell is a functional programming language but my devotion 
    to imperative OOP style programming crossfires with Haskell. You can say it's more to my style (no pun intended). 
    Second, Haskell is considered
