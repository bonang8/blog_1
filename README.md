   Haskell's Got Style 
   ____________________________________________
    ** Functional Programming 
    Haskell is a purely functional programming language. To put it simply, its a style of programming 
    in which the basic method of computation is the application of functions to arguments(p.4). 
    How does functional programming benefit us? Given haskell's ability to treat functions as values,
    the code is easier to debug and it's more concise.

   ** Which external sources (videos, blogs, tutorials, etc) do you find most useful?
   Top two must read resources are Learn you a Haskell for great good and Programming in Haskell. 
   Both illustrate ideas imperative to Haskell in the most simplest way.
